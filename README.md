# Network-Sniffing


To run the packet sniffer, execute the script from the command line with the following command

```
python Sniffing.py <interface>

```


Replace '<interface>' with the name of the network interface you want to sniff packets on



Open another terminal and run your commands

```
nmap <interface>

```



After sucessfully running nmap command then 'stop' the packet analyzer with 'ctrl+c'




Then, check log file which was captured by network sniffer and 'cat' it out




You have sucessfully captured Network Traffic with this tool





We developed a simple network packet sniffer using PYTHON and SCAPY. While this project focuses on capturing TCP packets, the functionality can be extended to support other protocols and perform advanced analysis

Packet sniffers are powerful tools for understanding network behaivour and diagnosing network issues, making them invaluable in various networking scenerios.
